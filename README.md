# druid-rust-calculator
A simple calculator using Druid GUI (based on https://github.com/linebender/druid/blob/master/druid/examples/calc.rs). I am using this project to better
learn Rust and the Druid library. All credit for features I did not implement belongs to the Druid team.

Changes:
* Use rug for representation
* Use a module-based layout for files
* Added modulo, exponent, and left and right shift

Current Interface:
